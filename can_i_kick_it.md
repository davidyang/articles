# Can I kick it? Yes you can.

Surprisingly, one of the most common questions admits to Fullstack ask is, "Am I really ready for this?" "Will I be able to handle it?"

The root of this question is a feeling of, "Am I good enough?" This thought is not only common amongst new admits, but also in current students, many of whom are used to being at the top of their class and are suddenly overwhelmed by the quality of their classmates.

###Yes, you belong here
When I was in grad school at UPenn, I attended a seminar on "imposter syndrome" that described exactly how I was feeling at the time. Imposter syndrome is described as "...feelings of inadequacy that persist even in face of information that indicates that the opposite is true." Despite getting in after a thorough interview process, you may still believe you don't belong.

###We believe in you
The good news in all this is that the impostor syndrome is generally associated with high achieving and highly successful people. So, congratulations, you've set a high bar for yourself. Well, not coincidentally, we've also set a high bar for you and we believe in you, and that's why we admitted you. 

Secondly, getting in to a top coding school is not easy, and while I don't want you to be over-confident, you *should* be proud of yourself. We know accepting someone is a serious committment and we would only make that committment if we felt confident that you could do it!

So pat yourself on the back, take a deep breath, and get ready for the most productive, fun and transformational time of your life. We're excited to see you on campus.
